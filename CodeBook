R-program:

Run "run_analysis.R" to clean up the data. Steps given below.

  1. Merging the training and test datasets (i.e. train/X_train.txt with test/X_test.txt; train/subject_train.txt with test/subject_test.txt; train/y_train.txt with test/y_test.txt)

  2. Reading features.txt and extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

  3. Reading activity_labels.txt and appling descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set, such as walking,walkingupstairs,
     walkingdownstairs, sitting, standing and laying

  4. labelling dataset -attributes & activity to lower case (underscores and brackets removed).

  5. Saving result as 'merged_clean_data.txt' 
  
  6. Creating an independent tidydata set with the average of each measurement for each activity and each subject, saving as dataset_average.
